excerpt: 'In this paper we present a novel legal holding documents summarization technique with Italian-LEGAL-BERT. The paper was accepted to 19th Internation Conference on AI and Law (ICAIL-23). This paper was a part of giustizia agile project (an Italian nation wide project to fasten the Judicial system using AI)'

Legal holdings are used in Italy as a critical component of the legal system, serving to establish legal precedents, provide guidance for future legal decisions, and ensure consistency and predictability in the interpretation and application of the law. They are written by domain experts who describe in a clear and concise manner the principle of law applied in the judgments.
We introduce a legal holding extraction method based on Italian-LEGAL-BERT to automatically extract legal holdings from Italian cases. In addition, we present ITA-CaseHold, a benchmark dataset for Italian legal summarization. We conducted several experiments using this dataset, as a valuable baseline for future research on this topic.
